# CFC-2022-METADATA
A semi-accurate CFC metadata file for the 2024 college football season, based on the AP Poll, conference odds, and general insight.

This file is for the CFC (College Football Coach) app on IOS/App Store. This can be imported when creating a league by pasting the link to the raw JSON when prompted.
When creating a league, these are my recommended settings:

•Mode: Career
I recommend this setting to allow you to play with the most amount of programs as a coach. You can create multiple coaches for multiple schools in this mode, rather than being locked into a single school. This is only a recommendation, and is not important if your preference is school mode.

•Difficulty: Hard
I recommend this setting simply because easy mode will become, well, too easy. If you want to feel the struggles of playing as a football program, Hard mode will give this effect. After just a couple seasons in easy mode, you will likely be winning by 40 points every game, even against the top-ranked teams. The difference is startling. This is, in my opinion, one of the most important settings, even if you are a new player.

•Manually Manage Coaching Staff: On
This setting can be annoying every few seasons when switched on, but I recommend it because it will cost you extra points to hire coaches, instead of dedicating all of them to recruiting. This will slightly balance your team and recruiting. This is not mandatory, but again, it will help create the immersion of growing pains.

•Enable Promotion/Relegation: Either
This is all personal preference. When enabled, the bottom team(s) in a conference will be relegated. There are 6 power conferences and 6 lower conferences. If you do enable this, I encourage you to only promote/relegate 1 team per conference.

•"Club of 6 Prestige Cap": Enabled at 75
I recommend this setting to slow the growth of the lower 6 conferences. When this is not enabled, you might see teams like Eastern Michigan become super-teams and dominate the college football world for multiple consecutive seasons. Limiting this at 75 will allow these programs to recruit 4 and 5 star players, but only ones from in-state. 80 would be my other recommendation if you wanted them to recruit 4 star players, but if you want to go higher than 80, you might as well not enable this. 

•Enable In-Season Recruiting: ON
This setting being enabled will allow you to recruit throughout the season, monitoring the progress of certain players. If it is off, you will only be able to recruit in the off-season, and that both makes recruiting a little too easy, and ruins the immersion. 

Other things I encourage after creating the league:

•Auto Recruiting: OFF
This is a prompt you will see when you look at the recruiting tab in the game. It will automatically spend your points on players. The catch, though, is that it is really bad at its job. You will get poor recruiting classes and, if you have to manage your coaching staff, it will never leave you with the points to do it. This is something I definitely stand by, do not turn this on.

•Simulate the games, or watch them live.
When you go to play a game, you will asked to simulate it, watch it, or play it. I recommend simulating or watching it. Playing the games often makes the game much easier. There is no problem with playing the games, if you like, but just note that you might win more than your program "deserves to" if you do. 

•Limit your recruiting
If you find recruiting to be too easy, maybe try personal limits. Maybe limit yourself to only 3 5-star players, or maybe you have to spend 25% of your points on the transfer portal. Whatever you decide, if you get too many good players, try limiting yourself when the game doesn't.

Current Issues:
•Head Coaches not accurate: This is a planned update if I find the time, right now all coaches are random.
•Innacurate Conferences: There are 12 conferences in this game, rather than 10. Each conference has 10 teams with no divisions, so I had to make some adjustments, adding 1 Power conference and 1 "lower" conference. The Continental Conference is the new Power conference, and the Independence conference is the new lower conference. The Continental is based on Power 5 teams that were removed from their conferences for space, and the Independence conference is based on the original 13 colonies, along with the service academies. 
•Missing teams. Below I will list the teams I had to remove. If you want, you can edit teams in the game to re-add these teams very easily. 
-Stanford
-Colorado
-Colorado State
-Charlotte
-NIU
-Buffalo
-Marshall
-ULM
-New Mexico State
-Old Dominion

-------------------------

That's pretty much it! I hope you guys enjoy the file, and I hope it keeps itself semi-accurate for at least a few seasons (sorry Akron, no playoffs for you). I plan to update it in the future, if I can find the time. Until then, have fun creating a dynasty!
